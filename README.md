# Successful Applications

All the job and grant applications here are successful, hopefully providing a diverse perspective on what has worked in jobs and funding.

### Job Applications

Job applications now include cover letters, CVs, research, teaching, and diversity statements, and even some interview presentations. 
I've divided them up into industry/nonprofit research, research university, and primarily undergradguate university.
There is a bias towards plants and evolution, as that's folks I know and can badger into contributing. 

Also check out [UCSF](https://career.ucsf.edu/gsp/cvs-resumes-cover-letters#Sample-resumes) and [EMBO Fellows](https://www.embl.org/about/info/embl-fellows-career-service/info-resources/job-applications/#vf-tabs__section-c3642e1b-1236-4982-910c-87fc1084ccc9) for some guidance and a few more examples. 

### Grants
